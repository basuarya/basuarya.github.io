    "text": "Bio:\nDr. Aryabrata Basu is a Virtual Reality/Human-Computer Interaction researcher investigating human spatial decision-making in virtual environments and its impact on translational training and skill-building. Dr. Basu completed his Ph.D. in computer sciences from the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens, GA focusing on designing and evaluating ubiquitous wearable Virtual Reality experiences. As part of his graduate school curriculum, Dr. Basu has designed and deployed extensive user studies in the field involving 100 plus subjects at a time.\nFrom 2016 to 2022, Dr. Basu has spearheaded the public scholarship mission through meaningful 3D visualization and effective human-computer interaction at Emory University’s Center for Digital Scholarship. As a staff research scientist, he has created and configured real-time simulations (of places/spaces of historical importance) using a variety of 3D computer modeling, simulation software, and geospatial data. He has been engaged in the active development of Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality-based visualization projects in an academic setting by serving various departments ranging from Art History to the School of Medicine.\nDr. Basu is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at UA Little Rock and a research fellow in the Emerging Analytics Center in the EIT building. Dr. Basu is passionate about creating experiential simulations of places that do not exist or hyper-realistic spaces to understand human behavior in simulated space-time."

    "text": "&gt;&gt; 05/07/2024: The last few weeks have been spent tackling novel technical challenges in my venture to truly distribute 3D meshes over a network using Unity. This subproject is part of the advanced data visualization efforts of the #DART (Data Analytics that are Robust and Trusted) project, accessible at [https://dartproject.org/].\n\nHere are the key hurdles I navigated:\n\nAdvanced Serialization: Developing a custom mesh serializer and deserializer (works on the fly) from scratch to ensure that complex 3D data transmits accurately and efficiently over different network conditions was challenging and rewarding.\n\nNetwork Efficiency: The main goal was to minimize latency and maximize throughput within a host-client topology. This required innovative solutions in data compression and chunking strategies to handle real-time mesh updates without sacrificing performance.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; 04/25/2024: I am thrilled to share that Mohammad Jahed Murad Sunny, a dedicated Master’s student I have the privilege of mentoring, has been recognized with an award at this year’s Student Research and Creative Works Expo at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR) for our collaborative work on human spatial decision-making in immersive virtual environments.\n\nCongratulations to Jahed and all involved in this year’s expo for pushing the boundaries of knowledge and creativity!\n\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt; 04/08/2024: In the tapestry of celestial events that adorn our sky, few phenomena evoke a sense of ethereal wonder and existential introspection as profoundly as a total solar eclipse. This surreal experience, where day momentarily succumbs to an eerie twilight, invites us not only to marvel at the spectacle but also to ponder the intricate dance between light and shadow, presence and absence, finitude and infinity.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt; 03/21/2024: I am thrilled to share the remarkable achievements of our students, “Jayasri” Sai Nikitha Guthula and Mohammad Jahed Murad Sunny, who presented their critical research at the IEEE VR 2024 conference.\n\nTheir work, exploring gender biases in XR technologies and spatial decision-making in immersive virtual environments, showcases our commitment to inclusive and innovative technology development. Their contributions underscore the importance of diversity in tech and the intricacies of navigation in virtual spaces. I am proud of their contributions and looking forward to further advancements they will bring to the field!\n\nSpecial thanks to the Emerging Analytics Center at UA Little Rock for providing our students with the perfect tinkering space as budding engineers.\n\nUniversity of Arkansas at Little Rock\n#IEEEVR2024 #InclusiveTech #VirtualReality\n\n\n&gt;&gt; 02/21/2024: Integrating the Unity game engine into our Computer Networks curriculum represents a groundbreaking shift towards a more interactive and applied learning experience. This innovative approach allows students to practically apply and visualize complex network concepts and protocols within Unity’s dynamic environment, bridging the theoretical and practical aspects of the subject.\nBy adopting Unity, we’re not just teaching Computer Networks but preparing students to innovate and lead in the tech industry. This approach underscores our commitment to providing a modern, comprehensive education that equips students to shape the future of technology.\n\nP.S. Making things (3d objects) move via TCP socket programming can be super fun!\n\nEmerging Analytics Center at UA Little Rock\nUniversity of Arkansas at Little Rock\n\n\nCopyright © Aryabrata Basu 2024"
