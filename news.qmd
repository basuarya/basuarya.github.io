\>\> **03/21/2024**: I am thrilled to share the remarkable achievements of our students, ["Jayasri" Sai Nikitha Guthula](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACe8gl4B4UEQd5VKFiHMlqP6V9clU8PTF_g) and [Mohammad Jahed Murad Sunny](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAB2UKjgB8f9FPaUiNA1STJtBV5DF4cnvjO8), who presented their critical research at the [IEEE](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ieee/) VR 2024 conference.\
\
Their work, exploring gender biases in XR technologies and spatial decision-making in immersive virtual environments, showcases our commitment to inclusive and innovative technology development. Their contributions underscore the importance of diversity in tech and the intricacies of navigation in virtual spaces. I am proud of their contributions and looking forward to further advancements they will bring to the field!\
