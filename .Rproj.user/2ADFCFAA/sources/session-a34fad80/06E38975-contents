Dr. Basu is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at UA Little Rock and a research fellow in the Emerging Analytics Center in the EIT building. Dr. Basu is passionate about creating experiential simulations of places that do not exist or hyper-realistic spaces to understand human behavior in simulated space-time.

Below is an example video-grab of my current research topic into human spatial decision-making!
